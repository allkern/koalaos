koalaOS boot process:

1. system is reset, execution starts at bfc00000 (KSEG1), 64 KiB ROM containing firmware is mapped to this area
2. firmware initializes minimal set of hardware (UART, NVS)
3. firmware searches a bootable partition on all 4 NVS slots
4. firmware finds a bootable partition, mounts it and searches a file matching the name 'kernel'
5. firmware finds kernel file, reads it from disk, copies it to main memory at virtual 80000080 (physical 00000080)
6. firmware resets SR BEV bit (change exception vector area to KSEG0)
7. firmware triggers syscall with $a0 set to 80000000 (SYS_LOAD_OS), $a1 set to (nvs_slot | partition << 2)
8. execution is transferred to kernel, kernel mounts filesystem and loads executable named 'system' to main memory
9. kernel sets up MMU, TLB and 
10. kernel is resident on main memory, execution is transferred to system's entry point
